      "response_text": "Absolutely. I've been working with Python for about six years now, primarily in backend development. The project I'm most proud of is a real-time data pipeline I built at my current company. We were processing clickstream data from our e-commerce platform, handling about 50,000 events per second. I designed the architecture using Apache Kafka for ingestion and built custom consumers in Python with asyncio. The system reduced our data latency from hours to under 30 seconds.",
